## Concept

*"In computer science, interactive computation is a mathematical model for computation that involves input/output communication with the external world during computation. This is in contrast to the traditional understanding of computation which assumes reading input only before computation and writing output only after computation, thus defining a kind of "closed" computation." (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_computation)*

Using this paradigma, some companies are investing on software that are interactive with the users in order to give them the feeling that there is a communication happening between human and machine. A software example is XBOX Kinect, which copy the player's movements on the game character.

## Benefits
Interactive Computation can be beneficial for almost all industries like, education, construction, health, agriculture, etc. For the education industry, it can provide visual experiences for theories that usually are only taught with an algebraic expression. A good example that is already available in the market, is the *inFORM* software, which can render 3D content physically. Imagine the possibilities that it can open, like rendering a perfect sample of a human's heart for Medical school, or, engineers being able to manipulate a rendered terrain model to simulate how the new building would behave. The old sentence, an image worth more than a thousand words, fits perfectly on this technology potential.

Another good benefit that Interactive Software can bring is to motivate kids to be eager to learn and explore more the subjects. Schools have been introducing technologies on their system to bring more variety on theirs curriculum in exchange to attract more students.
Children have deal to technology every day, so if they could use it at school, their motivation would be increased.
