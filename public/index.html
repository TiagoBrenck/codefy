<h2 id="concept">Concept</h2>

<p><em>&ldquo;In computer science, interactive computation is a mathematical model for computation that involves input/output communication with the external world during computation. This is in contrast to the traditional understanding of computation which assumes reading input only before computation and writing output only after computation, thus defining a kind of &ldquo;closed&rdquo; computation.&rdquo; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_computation">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_computation</a>)</em></p>

<p>Using this paradigma, some companies are investing on software that are interactive with the users in order to give them the feeling that there is a communication happening between human and machine. A software example is XBOX Kinect, which copy the player&rsquo;s movements on the game character.</p>

<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>

<p>Interactive Computation can be beneficial for almost all industries like, education, construction, health, agriculture, etc. For the education industry, it can provide visual experiences for theories that usually are only taught with an algebraic expression. A good example that is already available in the market, is the <em>inFORM</em> software, which can render 3D content physically. Imagine the possibilities that it can open, like rendering a perfect sample of a human&rsquo;s heart for Medical school, or, engineers being able to manipulate a rendered terrain model to simulate how the new building would behave. The old sentence, an image worth more than a thousand words, fits perfectly on this technology potential.</p>

<p>Another good benefit that Interactive Software can bring is to motivate kids to be eager to learn and explore more the subjects. Schools have been introducing technologies on their system to bring more variety on theirs curriculum in exchange to attract more students.
Children have deal to technology every day, so if they could use it at school, their motivation would be increased.</p>

<h2 id="iot">IoT</h2>

<p>IoT stands for Internet of Things, and it is  basically a network of physical devices that share data and communicate with each other.</p>

<p>Some IoT examples are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Automated Home</li>
<li>Smart cities (city services exchanging data to take decision)</li>
<li>Smart watches</li>
<li>Gardening sensors</li>
<li>Heart beat tracker</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="aws-iot">AWS IoT</h2>

<p>“AWS IoT is a managed cloud platform that lets connected devices - cars, light bulbs, sensor grids, and more - easily and securely interact with cloud applications and other devices.” (Amazon.com description). This service allows you to connect, store states, and manage the devices on the cloud. It can also process data, filter them, transform and act upon data from the devices on the fly. In other words, it provides you services where you can create your own code that can trigger others AWS services.</p>

<h3 id="communication">Communication</h3>

<p>The communication can be done via four types of protocols:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left">Protocol</th>
<th align="left">Authentication</th>
<th align="left">Port</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="left">MQQT</td>
<td align="left">Client Certificate</td>
<td align="left">8883</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left">HTTP</td>
<td align="left">Client Certificate</td>
<td align="left">8443</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left">HTTP</td>
<td align="left">SigV4</td>
<td align="left">443</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left">MQTT + WebSocket</td>
<td align="left">SigV4</td>
<td align="left">443</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h3 id="rules">Rules</h3>

<p>When you are creating your AWS IoT service, you have the option to setup what they call Rules. Rules give your devices the ability to interact with AWS services. You can use rules to support tasks like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Save a file to Amazon S3.</li>
<li>Invoke a Lambda function to extract data.</li>
<li>Send a push notification to all users using Amazon SNS.</li>
<li>Write data received from a device to an Amazon DynamoDB database.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="device-shadows">Device Shadows</h3>

<p>A thing shadow is a JSON document that is used to store and retrieve current state information for a thing (device, app, and so on). You can use thing shadows to get and set the state of a thing over MQTT or HTTP, regardless of whether the thing is connected to the Internet. Each thing shadow is uniquely identified by its name. With that, your physical devices won&rsquo;t miss any update in case they get disconnected.</p>

<h3 id="quick-tutorial">Quick Tutorial</h3>

<p>Creating your thing on AWS IoT is easy.</p>

<ol>
<li>First log in your AWS account (<a href="aws.amazon.com">AWS Link</a>) and select <strong>AWS IoT</strong>.</li>
<li>On the right sidebar, click on <strong>Registry &gt; Register a thing</strong>.</li>
<li>Type the name of your thing (for example &ldquo;MyFirstThing&rdquo;) and click on <strong>Create Thing</strong>.</li>
<li>Amazon will redirect you to a screen where you can see your created thing inside a box. This means that your thing is created, however it needs the certifications for the communication between you app and AWS IoT. So, for that, <strong>click on that box</strong>.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Security</strong> tab, click on <strong>Create certificate</strong>.</li>
<li>Just by clicking the button, the certifications get created and you have the links to download it. On the same screen, click on the <strong>Attach a policy</strong> button.</li>
<li>Policies are like permissions for that certificate. You can have a certificate with admin privileges and another with just read privileges. For the sake of this example, we are going to create an admin one. Click on <strong>Create new policy</strong>.</li>
<li>Name it Admin and inside the Action textbox, type <strong>*</strong>. For the Effect option, click <strong>Allow</strong> (we are allowing the action to be executed), then click on <strong>Create</strong> button.</li>
<li>Now, click on <strong>Security &gt; Certificates</strong>. Select your certificate and click on <strong>Action</strong> located on the bottom right of the black box containing your certificate ID. Then, click on <strong>Attach policy</strong>, select the Admin policy that we have just created and click <strong>Attach</strong>.</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Action</strong> again, but this time select <strong>Attach a thing</strong>. Then select our thing, MyFirstThing, and click <strong>Attach</strong>.</li>
<li>By this step, you have your thing created with its certificates and policies attached. If you click on <strong>Registry &gt; Things &gt; MyFirstThing &gt; Interact</strong>, Amazon has provided you the REST API Endpoint for you interact with your thing.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="esp8266-and-aws">ESP8266 and AWS</h3>

<p>In order to connect your AWS IoT with ESP8266 module (Arduino wifi shield) you can use these two libraries and it setup according to this code.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;AmazonIOTClient.h&gt;
#include &lt;ESP8266AWSImplementations.h&gt;

void initAWS()
{
  iotClient.setAWSRegion(&quot;eu-west-1&quot;);
  iotClient.setAWSEndpoint(&quot;amazonaws.com&quot;);
  iotClient.setAWSDomain(&quot;xxx.amazonaws.com&quot;);
  iotClient.setAWSPath(&quot;/things/XXX/shadow&quot;);
  iotClient.setAWSKeyID(&quot;XXX&quot;);
  iotClient.setAWSSecretKey(&quot;YYY&quot;);
  iotClient.setHttpClient(&amp;httpClient);
}

</code></pre>

<h1 id="the-project">The Project</h1>

<p>My roommates are two exciting engineers, that love to create prototypes and small projects. Last winter, they built a coffee machine operated by an Arduino Board. Their idea was to create an automatic coffee machine, that you could configure the time for it to start. When the project was half done, they asked me if I could make an app that would trigger the coffee machine, because they wanted to do it while they are still on bed.</p>

<p>The app idea was super excited, so I decided to accept the challenge and develop something for them. The app project was also used for a course on my post graduation studies (Web and Mobile Development and Design in <a href="https://langara.ca/">Langara</a>). So it was a win-win situation. In summary, the project scope was to create an App (for Android and iOS) capable to send a signal to the Arduino Board, that would process this call and trigger the coffee machine. We called it Smart Coffee.</p>

<h1 id="the-technologies">The Technologies</h1>

<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>

<ul>
<li>Arduino Mega</li>
<li>Wifi shield ESP8266</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="software">Software</h2>

<ul>
<li>Visual Studio 2017</li>
<li>Xamarin</li>
<li>Android SDK 5.1</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="the-solution">The Solution</h1>

<p>I am not going to focus on the Xamarin code because my intention here is to show how to integrate an App with an Arduino, regardless the framework.</p>

<p>Our first task was to configure ESP8266 with my local network. For that we used the following code, found at <a href="https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/blob/master/libraries/ESP8266WiFi/examples/WiFiClientBasic/WiFiClientBasic.ino">LINK</a></p>

<pre><code>/*
 *  This sketch sends a message to a TCP server
 *
 */

#include &lt;ESP8266WiFi.h&gt;
#include &lt;ESP8266WiFiMulti.h&gt;

ESP8266WiFiMulti WiFiMulti;

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(115200);
    delay(10);

    // We start by connecting to a WiFi network
    WiFiMulti.addAP(&quot;SSID&quot;, &quot;passpasspass&quot;);

    Serial.println();
    Serial.println();
    Serial.print(&quot;Wait for WiFi... &quot;);

    while(WiFiMulti.run() != WL_CONNECTED) {
        Serial.print(&quot;.&quot;);
        delay(500);
    }

    Serial.println(&quot;&quot;);
    Serial.println(&quot;WiFi connected&quot;);
    Serial.println(&quot;IP address: &quot;);
    Serial.println(WiFi.localIP());

    delay(500);
}


void loop() {
    const uint16_t port = 80;
    const char * host = &quot;192.168.1.1&quot;; // ip or dns



    Serial.print(&quot;connecting to &quot;);
    Serial.println(host);

    // Use WiFiClient class to create TCP connections
    WiFiClient client;

    if (!client.connect(host, port)) {
        Serial.println(&quot;connection failed&quot;);
        Serial.println(&quot;wait 5 sec...&quot;);
        delay(5000);
        return;
    }

    // This will send the request to the server
    client.print(&quot;Send this data to server&quot;);

    //read back one line from server
    String line = client.readStringUntil('\r');
    client.println(line);

    Serial.println(&quot;closing connection&quot;);
    client.stop();

    Serial.println(&quot;wait 5 sec...&quot;);
    delay(5000);
}

</code></pre>

<p>Once we stablished the connection, my roommates configured the pins so every time we had a connection, the arduino board would light up a LED. On this stage we had our connection working and the integration between Wifi Shield and Board working properly.</p>

<p>The next step was to create a loop statement on the Wifi Shield, in order to listen for requests. That was done by using the ESP8266 library, which contains the method recv().</p>

<pre><code>uint8_t buffer[128] = {0};
uint8_t mux_id;
uint32_t len = wifi.recv(&amp;mux_id, buffer, sizeof(buffer), 100);

if (len &gt; 0) { //I got a request }

</code></pre>

<p>With that done, the last step was to create an event handler on the app to send a HTTP request to the WiFi Shield IP Address. On the request, I used a query string to send how many cups the user wants. On the Arduino side, it reads the query string and calls the appropriate code. Also, it sends a HTTP 200 response to the app, confirming the request&rsquo; success.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>In conclusion, we created a loop to listen for any HTTP request, and once it captures one, it would process it and send a HTTP response. For the app side, it just needed to send a HTTP request to the WiFi Shield IP with the cups as query string.</p>

  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    

<p>Object Orientation has so many principles and theories behind it, that is quite impossible to have an architecture that uses 100% of it. To decide which principles should be ignored, you have to consider how complex is your app, how often will it be updated, how many users will access it and many others considerations. However, the <strong>SOLID</strong> principles fit on almost all scenarios and should be considered to be implemented on every architecture because the benefits of it are countless. Furthermore, the time you will spend implementing them is minimal.</p>

<p>The 5 SOLID principles are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>S</strong> -&gt; <a href="#single-responsibility">Single Responsibility principle</a></li>
<li><strong>O</strong> -&gt; <a href="#open-closed">Open/Closed principle</a></li>
<li><strong>L</strong> -&gt; <a href="#liskov-substitution">Liskov Substitution principle</a></li>
<li><strong>I</strong> -&gt; <a href="#interface-segregation">Interface Segregation principle</a></li>
<li><strong>D</strong> -&gt; <a href="#dependency-inversion">Dependency Inversion principle</a></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="single-responsibility">Single Responsibility</h2>

<p>A class should have only one reason to change. In other words, a class should be responsible for only one subject and has only functions related to that subject. For example, on an e-commerce app, a class called PricingServices should only have functions related to price. Submitting an order isn&rsquo;t its responsibility so it shouldn&rsquo;t have any code or business rules for that.</p>

<h3 id="benefits">Benefits</h3>

<p>By adopting the Single Responsibility principle, you are ensuring that you have a level of clean code on your project, helping future maintenances easier to be done and less prone to bugs. Also, the principle makes your classes be more robust.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="open-closed">Open Closed</h2>

<p>Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modifications, that is, such an entity can allow its behavior to be extended without modifying its source code. You want your code to be easier to be extended as possible and not having to modify the whole application.</p>

<p>Using the same PricingServices example that we used above, you have a class that knows how to price your selling products. Since your e-commerce only sells food, the tax rate to be applied on every product is fixed. If your company starts selling kitchen gadgets, you would have two categories of products with different taxes rates from each other. A good usage of the Open/Closed principle for this scenario is to have the class PricingServices&rsquo; methods expecting a generic type of product. Using this approach, the prices calculations wouldn&rsquo;t be based on a fixed type of product and the class would be opened to deal with any kind of products, without having its code modified.</p>

<h3 id="benefits-1">Benefits</h3>

<p>By using the Open/Closed principle, you are increasing the scalability of the software and reducing its coupling. Changes are easy to be implemented and you have the safety that the new extension won&rsquo;t brake any existing business rules.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="liskov-substitution">Liskov Substitution</h2>

<p>The object of a derived class should be able to replace an object of the base class without bringing any errors in the system or modifying the behavior of the base class. This principle is about following the contract of the base class.</p>

<p>An example of a class structure which violates Liskov Substitution is:</p>

<pre><code> public interface IDuck
 {
    void Swim();
    // contract says that IsSwimming should be true if Swim has been called.
    bool IsSwimming { get; }
 }

 public class OrganicDuck : IDuck
 {
    public void Swim()
    {
       //do something to swim
    }

    bool IsSwimming { get { /* return if the duck is swimming */ } }
 }

 public class ElectricDuck : IDuck
 {
    bool _isSwimming;

    public void Swim()
    {
       if (!IsTurnedOn)
         return;

       _isSwimming = true;
       //swim logic  

    }

    bool IsSwimming { get { return _isSwimming; } }
 }
</code></pre>

<p>And the calling code:</p>

<pre><code>  void MakeDuckSwim(IDuck duck)
  {
      duck.Swim();
  }
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, there are two examples of ducks. One organic duck and one electric duck. The electric duck can only swim if it&rsquo;s turned on. This breaks the Liskov Substitution principle since it must be turned on to be able to swim as the IsSwimming (which also is part of the contract) won&rsquo;t be set as in the base class. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4428725/can-you-explain-liskov-substitution-principle-with-a-good-c-sharp-example">Code Source</a></p>

<h3 id="benefits-2">Benefits</h3>

<p>Similar to Open/Closed principle, the benefits of using Liskov are to increase the scalability of the software. Also, it ensure that future new subclasses won&rsquo;t break any tested code.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="interface-segregation">Interface Segregation</h2>

<p>It states that no client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. Basically the idea is to split interfaces that are very large into smaller and more specific ones. This principle has a small similarity with Single Responsibility, however it is focused on interfaces.</p>

<p>A super generic interface, that represents everything in your business world, is actually a spaghetti interface. If you have a vehicle subject app, and decides to create an interface that wraps the behavior of all kind of vehicles, you could come with something like this:</p>

<pre><code>public IVehicle
{
  void StartEngine();
  void Accelerate();
  void Break();
  void ChangeGear(int newGear);
  void TurnRadioOnOff();
  void EjectCD();
}

<p>Having that interface as example, if you have a car, that has radio with CD feature and is manual, the interface works fine. However, An automatic car is also a vehicle. As well as motorcycles and buses. They can only implement some of the interface contracts, while the others would have to return null or some illogical rule.</p>

<h3 id="benefits-3">Benefits</h3>

<p>The benefits of using Interface Segregation resume to a clean and more cohered code. Adopting this principle may result into creating more interfaces, but on the other hand, you won&rsquo;t have concrete classes that implement an interface but are not actually represented by that interface.</p>

<h2 id="dependency-inversion">Dependency Inversion</h2>

<p>High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.</p>

<p>Design your software in modules, the 3 tier architecture is a good example, and make them independent of each other. If one module should send data or use another module, do it through interfaces and dependency injection.</p>

<p>In a real world scenario, you have your business module containing all the business rules, validations and stuff. This module needs to get data from the database and send them back updated. Is it important to the business module what DB are you using? Or, if you are using an ORM such as Entity Framework or NHibernate? The answer should be no, because rules like new users must have a valid email, or the field foo is mandatory, should be applied if your DB is MYSQL, SQL Server, Mongo or whatever. So, to accomplish the dependency inversion, you create an interface for your DB module, which the business module will be dependent on. With that architecture, if you change your DB from MySql to SQL Server for example, your business module will not need any modification.</p>

<h3 id="benefits-4">Benefits</h3>

<p>Adopting the Dependency Inversion principle, you increase your software scalability, decrease its coupling and create independent modules that can be modified or re-utilized without stress.</p>
